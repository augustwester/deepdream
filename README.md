# DeepDream in PyTorch

![deepdream-examples](examples.png)

This repo contains an implementation of the DeepDream algorithm in PyTorch. It is based on my blog post over at [sigmoid prime](https://sigmoidprime.com/). I suggest you read that if you want some intuition for how DeepDream works. If you just want to get into the nitty gritty details, take a look at `dream.py` and `helpers.py`.

If you simply want to create your own "dreams," I suggest you check out the Jupyter notebook in `example.ipynb`. It will allow you to run the algorithm on your own images and tweak all the relevant parameters.
